# Sharehen

`Sharehen` aims to help low-income persons share ride with volunteers. In Kenya, public transport offers a very expensive and bad service. The operators are rude and abusive. Moving from one town to another is stressful when using public transport. From observations, most of the private cars travelling from one part of the country to another, mostly have empty sits.

We aim to connect individual travelling to the same sides of the country. The ride owner can decide to charge a fee, based on what they think is best for both parties. When the ride owner volunteers for rides the riders can see how much the owner is charging for the ride. A ride can put an offer on the amount they have. The owner can choose the offers they want.

`Sharehen` is a long-distance ride-sharing application. The application enables individuals on a journey that takes more than 2 hours to share their ride. The car owner volunteers to share their ride and accept the invitation from the individual who is in need of the service. Through the application, a client can see the people who are willing to share their rides. They then make a request.

For example in Kenya, for those travelling from the city to their remote locations or other cities. For example from Nairobi to Kakamega, Eldoret, Nakuru, Mombasa, Kitui, Embu, e.t.c.

The application can be used through the `Sharehen` mobile app or through the website `sharehen.com`
