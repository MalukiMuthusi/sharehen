# Sharehen

`Sharehen` aims to help low income persons share ride with volunteers. In Kenya the public transport offers a very expensive and bad service. The operators are rude and abusive. Moving from one town to anaother is stressful when using the public transport. From observations, most of the private cars travelling from one part of the country to another, mostly have empty sits.

We aim to connect individual travelling to the same sides of the country.

`Sharehen` is a long distance ride sharing application. The application enables individuals on a journey that takes more 2 hours to share their ride. The car owner volunteers to share their ride and accepts invitation from the individual who are in need of the service. Through the application a client can see the people who are willing to share their rides. They then make a request.

For example in Kenya, for those travelling from the city to their remote locations or other cities. For example from Nairobi to Kakamega, Eldoret, Nakuru, Mombasa, Kitui, Embu, e.t.c.

The application can be used through the `sherehen` mobile app or through the website `sherehen.com`
